# NV-SmartEnv-7Seg

An advanced, compact, and PC-independent Arduino-based environmental monitoring module designed to display temperature and humidity using a MAX7219-based 7-segment display.

This is a segment-display variant of the original [NV-SmartEnv-Controller](https://github.com/NVCreations33/NV-SmartEnv-Controller), built with all of its core capabilities and safety measures — but optimized for numeric output.
